# AoC_2023

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), written in Rust. To run a day, use either the `solve()` or `benchmark()` trait methods, passing in the input filepath, e.g.

```rust
let answer = days::Day1.solve("path/to/input.txt");
```

Or, to prettyprint, something like

```rust
println!("Day 1:\n{}", days::Day1.solve("path/to/input.txt"));
```
